                <h1 id="release-manager-guide">Release Manager Guide</h1>
<h2 id="role">Role</h2>
<p>The release manager is ultimately responsible for making sure that the development process is being followed during his
or her release.</p>
<p>The release manager has the following duties:</p>
<ul>
<li>To ensure that the release measures up to the quality expected by the community.</li>
<li>To ensure that the development process is followed and amended if required.</li>
<li>To ensure that the release is timely and does not languish in process.</li>
<li>To encourage committers to be involved in testing and fixing of bugs.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is in the release manager's responsibility to force decisions around the release, help negotiate the acceptance or
rejection of contributions and to provide regular updates about the release on list and during the weekly technical and
monthly adopter meetings. It is important to note that, while the release manager drives the release process, the
committer body is in charge of both the work and the decision making, meaning that votes and successful proposals from
this body take precedence over a release managers decision.</p>
<p>The release manager does not have to be a committer. In case the release manager is not, a committer must agree to be
the proxy release manager for communication on the confidential committers list.</p>
<p>A release manager can abandon the release at any time, giving up their duties and privileges of being the release
manager. The committer list must then either vote within 72 hours on a new release manager, or consider the release
abandoned (the major, minor, and maintenance numbers remain unchanged).</p>
<h2 id="duties">Duties</h2>
<h3 id="setting-release-schedule">Setting Release Schedule</h3>
<p>Releases should happen twice a year, usually within a time span of 9.5 months between the cut of the previous release
branch and the final release. The release manager should create a release schedule as soon as possible.
For more details about the release schedule, have a look at the <a href="../development-process/">Development Process</a></p>
<h3 id="creation-of-release-branch">Creation of Release Branch</h3>
<p>According to the set release schedule, at one point a release branch should be cut, effectively marking a feature freeze
for a given release.</p>
<p>Once a release process has started, a branch should be created with the proposed version number of that release. This
branch is created off of <code>develop</code> and should be named <code>r/X.Y.x</code> (e.g. <code>r/2.1.x</code> for the Opencast 2.1 release branch).
In the following command, we assume that the release branch for 2.1 is to be created. For other versions, please adjust
the version number accordingly.</p>
<p>Create the Branch:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Grab the merge ticket for <code>develop</code>. You are going to make changes there and it becomes ugly if someone else changes
   something at the same time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check out <code>develop</code> and make sure it has the latest state (replace <code>&lt;remote&gt;</code> with your remote name for the community
   repository):</p>
<pre><code>git checkout develop
git pull &lt;remote&gt; develop
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create and push release branch:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout -b r/2.1.x
git push &lt;remote&gt; r/2.1.x
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure you did not modify any files. If you did, stash those changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That is it for the release branch. Now lets make sure we update the versions in <code>develop</code> in preparation for the next
   release:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout develop
for i in `find . -name pom.xml`; do \
  sed -i 's/&lt;version&gt;2.1-SNAPSHOT&lt;!--&lt;version--&gt;2.2-SNAPSHOT&lt;!--' $i; done
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have a look at the changes. Make sure no library version we use has the version <code>2.1-SNAPSHOT</code> and was accidentally
   changed. Also make sure that nothing else was modified:</p>
<pre><code>git diff
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check again for unwanted changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If everything looks fine, commit everything and push it to the community repository:</p>
<pre><code>git commit -as
git push &lt;remote--&gt; develop
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally change the <code>fixVersion</code> and <code>summary</code> on the merge ticket for 2.1 and create a new one for develop.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, the developer community should then be notified. Consider using the following as a template email:</p>
<pre><code>To: matterhorn@opencast.org
Subject: Release Branch for Opencast &lt;VERSION&gt; Cut

Hi everyone,
it is my pleasure to announce that the &lt;VERSION&gt; release branch has now been
cut, available as r/&lt;VERSION&gt;. Pull requests for bug fixes are to be made
against this branch.

Remember that the release schedule for this release:

  &lt;RELEASE_SCHEDULE&gt;

As always, we hope to have a lot of people testing this version, especially
during the public QA phase.  Please report any bugs or issues you encounter.
</code></pre>
<h3 id="adjust-pull-request-filter">Adjust Pull Request Filter</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://pullrequests.opencast.org">Opencast pull request filter</a> links the versions currently in development. The
merge ticket identifier needs to be added to that filter. As release manager, please talk to the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/opencast-community/opencast-infrastructure">administrator
</a> of that tool to ensure the ticket is added.</p>
<h3 id="release-documentation">Release Documentation</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://docs.opencast.org">Opencast release documentation</a> will be built automatically from available release tags.
However, new branches need to be included.  As release manager, please talk to the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/opencast-community/opencast-infrastructure">administrator
</a> of that
tool to ensure the ticket is added.</p>
<h3 id="moderation-of-peer-reviews">Moderation of Peer Reviews</h3>
<p>Apart from creating branches and tags, one of the most important things for release managers to do is to ensure that
pull requests for the release are going forward. This does not mean that the release manager has to do the reviews, but
he should talk to developers, remind them about outstanding reviews and help to resolve possible issues.</p>
<h3 id="merging-release-branch-into-develop">Merging Release Branch Into Develop</h3>
<p>To not have to merge bug fixes into several branches and create several pull requests, the release manager should merge
the release branch back into <code>develop</code> on a regular basis. It is encouraged to do that frequently, to not let the
branches diverge too much and to avoid possible merge conflicts.</p>
<p>To merge the release branch into <code>develop</code>. As example, we do that for 2.1. Please adjust the version accordingly:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Grab the merge ticket for <code>develop</code>. You are not doing any changes to the release branch, so you will not need that
   merge ticket. If someone else holds the merge ticket for a feature pull request, talk to that person that you will
   temporarily steal the ticket.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update release branch:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout r/2.1.x
git pull &lt;remote&gt; r/2.1.x
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update <code>develop</code>:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout develop
git pull &lt;remote&gt; develop
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Merge the release branch. Not that if large merge conflicts arise, you may ask for help from the people creating the
   problematic patches:</p>
<pre><code>git merge r/2.1.x
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Push updated branch into the community repository:</p>
<pre><code>git push &lt;remote&gt; develop
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leave a comment in the merge ticket and assign it back to the next pull request in line on <code>develop</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="beta-versions-and-release-candidates">Beta Versions and Release Candidates</h3>
<p>For testing purposes, the release manager should regularly create beta versions. Especially before the public QA phase,
a beta version should exist. Additionally, he should create a release candidate for testing before proposing that a
release be cut.</p>
<p>Create a version/tag. Again, version 2.1 is used as example. Please adjust the version accordingly:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Switch to release branch you want to create the beta from:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout r/2.1.x
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Switch to a new branch to create the release (name does not really matter):</p>
<pre><code>git checkout -b r/2.1.0-beta1
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make version changes for release. You can use <code>sed</code> to make things easier. Please make sure, the changes are correct:</p>
<pre><code>for i in `find . -name pom.xml`; do \
  sed -i 's/&lt;version&gt;2.1-SNAPSHOT&lt;!--&lt;version--&gt;2.1.0-beta1&lt;!--' $i; done
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commit changes and create release tag:</p>
<pre><code>git commit -asS -m 'Opencast 2.1.0-beta1'
git tag -s 2.1.0-beta1
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Switch back to release branch and push tags:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout r/2.1.x
git push &lt;remote--&gt; 2.1.0-beta1:2.1.0-beta1
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can remove the new branch afterwards:</p>
<pre><code>git branch -D r/2.1.0-beta1
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For a release candidate, instead of <code>A.B.C-betaX</code> the tag should be named <code>A.B.C-rcX</code>.</p>
<p>At this point the developer community should then be notified. Consider using the following email template:</p>
<pre><code>To: matterhorn@opencast.org
Subject: &lt;VERSION&gt; Available for testing!

Hi everyone,
I am pleased to announce that Opencast &lt;VERSION&gt; is now available for
testing. Please download the source from BitBucket [1] or use git to check
out the tag.

Issue Count:

  Blockers   &lt;BLOCKER_COUNT&gt;
  Critical   &lt;CRITICAL_ISSUE_COUNT&gt;
  Major      &lt;MAJOR_ISSUE_COUNT&gt;
  Minor      &lt;MINOR_ISSUE_COUNT&gt;

Please test this release as thoroughly as
possible.

[1] https://bitbucket.org/opencast-community/matterhorn/downloads
</code></pre>
<p>If the version is a release candidate, you probably want to highlight that there are no <em>Blockers</em> left at the moment
and <em>#propose</em> this to become the final release.</p>
<h3 id="releasing">Releasing</h3>
<p>Once the proposal for a release candidate to become the final release has passed, the release manager should create the
final release. In the following example, again, version 2.1 is used. Please adjust the version accordingly. We also
assume the final release should be based on <code>2.1.0-rc2</code>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Check which commit the release candidate was based on:</p>
<pre><code>git merge-base 2.1.0-rc2 r/2.1.x
  060dfc3e2328518ae402846577fc6e7ce3b650d7
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Switch to commit you want to create the release from:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout 060dfc3e2328518ae402846577fc6e7ce3b650d7
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Switch to a new branch to create the release (name does not really matter):</p>
<pre><code>git checkout -b r/2.1.0
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add release notes and commit them:</p>
<pre><code>vim docs/guides/admin/docs/release.notes.md
git commit docs/guides/admin/docs/release.notes.md -sS
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Merge release notes into release branch:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout r/2.1.x
git merge r/2.1.0
git checkout r/2.1.0
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make version changes for release. You can use <code>sed</code> to make things easier. Please make sure, the changes are correct:</p>
<pre><code>for i in `find . -name pom.xml`; do \
  sed -i 's/&lt;version&gt;2.1-SNAPSHOT&lt;!--&lt;version--&gt;2.1.0&lt;!--' $i; done
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commit changes and create release tag:</p>
<pre><code>git commit -asS -m 'Opencast 2.1.0'
git tag -s 2.1.0
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Switch back to release branch, push release notes and tags:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout r/2.1.x
git push &lt;remote--&gt; 2.1.0:2.1.0
git push &lt;remote&gt; r/2.1.x
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can remove the new branch afterwards:</p>
<pre><code>git branch -D r/2.1.0
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, send a release notice to list. You may use the following template:</p>
<pre><code>To: matterhorn@opencast.org
Subject: Opencast &lt;VERSION&gt; Released
Hi all,

can be downloaded from BitBucket [1] or checked out via git.

The documentation for this release can be found at [http://docs.opencast.org].

Issue Count:

  Blockers   0
  Critical   &lt;CRITICAL_ISSUE_COUNT&gt;
  Major      &lt;MAJOR_ISSUE_COUNT&gt;
  Minor      &lt;MINOR_ISSUE_COUNT&gt;

To all committers and involved contributors, thank you for all your work.
This could not have happened without you and I am glad we were able to work
together and get this release out.

<h3 id="appointment-of-next-release-manager">Appointment of Next Release Manager</h3>
<h4 id="identification-of-a-volunteer">Identification of a volunteer</h4>
<p>After the release branch is cut, all work on <code>develop</code> is effectively the preparation for the next release. At this
point, the release manager sends an inquiry to the users, developers and community list to identify a volunteer for the
job of release manager for the next release.</p>
<p>For that, this email template may be used:</p>
<pre><code>To: matterhorn@opencast.org
Subject: Opencast &lt;NEXT_RELEASE_VERSION&gt; release manager wanted

Hi everyone,
as release manager of Opencast &lt;VERSION&gt; release, it is my duty to announce
that the Opencast community is looking for a release manager of the upcoming
&lt;NEXT_RELEASE_VERSION&gt; release between now and &lt;INTENDED RELEASE DATE&gt;
(release date).

Note that the release manager's duties do not contain a lot of technical
work. Instead, they focus on motivation, coordination, and ensuring that the
development process [1] is being followed. The role of the release manager
is described in more detail in the Opencast development documentation wiki
[2].

The job does not have to be done by one person alone and it has proven good
practice to have two people fill this job as co-release managers to help
keep up the process during vacation, sickness and in case of local
emergencies.

I am looking forward to your applications on list, please voice your
interest no later than &lt;TWO WEEKS FROM NOW&gt;.

</code></pre>
<h4 id="initiate-the-vote">Initiate the Vote</h4>
<p>In the case where someone steps up and offers to fill in the role of a release manager for the upcoming release, a vote
is held on the committers list to determine whether the candidate is deemed suitable for the position. Should there be
more than one candidate wanting to become the release manager for the next release, the candidate with the largest
number of votes and no “-1” gets elected.</p>
<p>This email template may be used to initiate the vote:</p>
<pre><code>To: committers@opencast.org
Subject: [#proposal] Vote on Release Managers of Opencast &lt;NEXT_RELEASE_VERSION&gt;

Hi everyone,
after roughly two weeks of looking for candidates for the position of the
release manager of the upcoming Opencast &lt;NEXT_RELEASE_VERSION&gt; release, I
am happy to announce that the following Opencast members have volunteered
for the position and have expressed the intention of sharing the position as
release managers:

  &lt;Name, Institition&gt;
  &lt;Name, Institution&gt;

As the release manager of Opencast &lt;BRANCH_VERSION_FINAL&gt; and in accordance
with the development process [1], I hereby open the vote on accepting the
applications of &lt;Name(s)&gt;. The vote will be open for the coming 72h.

[1] http://docs.opencast.org/develop/developer/development/
</code></pre>
<h4 id="announcing-election-results">Announcing Election Results</h4>
<p>Once the vote has been held, the current release manager announces the elected release manager on list, and the newly
elected release manager is expected to start work on the release shortly after.</p>
