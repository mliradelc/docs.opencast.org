In particular, it defines how patches can be\ncontributed, how they are merged and how releases are done.\n\n\nIf this document does not answer all of your questions, here is how you can get further help:\n\n\n\n\nAsk on the \nOpencast Development List\n\n\nChat with developers on \nIRC (#opencast on freenode)\n\n\nJoin our weekly technical meeting (see lists or IRC)\n\n\n\n\nContributing Code\n\n\nOpencast sources can be found on \nBitBucket\n. The easiest way to contribute\ncode to the project is by creating a pull request against the project's official repository. More details about the\nstructure of this repository are explained later in this guide.\n\n\nJira and BitBucket\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpencast uses \nJira\n for tracking issues. Each pull request should be accompanied by a\n   ticket in Jira. The issue identifier should also be used in the title of the pull request and the commits. E.g.:\n   \nMH-12345, Fixing Something Somewhere\n. Creating a Jira ticket is usually the first step when fixing something.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpencast uses \nBitBucket\n for code hosting. Please\n   \nfork\n the official\n   repository on BitBucket to \ncreate pull\n   requests\n from your repository\n   which will show up on the project's list of open pull requests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll open pull requests are listed on the \nOpencast Pull Request Filter\n. It might\n   take a couple of minutes for a new pull request to show up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBugfix vs Feature\n\n\nOpencast distinguishes between bug fix and feature pull requests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures are \nonly\n allowed to be merged into \ndevelop\n, which will let them automatically become part of the next\n   major/minor release, given that the release branch for the next release has not been cut yet. If possible, please\n   name branches containing features according to the pattern \nf/MH-XXXXX-short-description\n, where MH-XXXXX is the\n   relevant Jira ticket.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBug fixes can be merged both into \ndevelop\n and into release branches. If possible, please name branches containing\n   bug fixes according to the pattern \nt/MH-XXXXX-short-description\n, where MH-XXXXX is the relevant Jira ticket.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\nBefore a patch is merged, it needs to be reviewed by a committer. The reviewer makes sure that the patch merges\nwithout conflicts, that it works as expected and that it does not break anything else.\n\n\nIf the reviewer discovers any kind of issue, he should comment on the pull request in BitBucket, so that the author can\nfix the problem.\n\n\nFor more details about the review and merge process, have a look at \nReviewing, Merging and Declining Pull\nRequests\n.\n\n\nCoding Rules\n\n\nMaven will automatically check for coding style violations and interrupt the process if it founds any, displaying a\nmessage about it. Apart from that, here are some general rules:\n\n\nJava:\n\n\n\n\nIndentation is done with exactly two spaces\n\n\nNo line of code should be wider than 120 columns\n\n\nAvoid trailing spaces\n\n\nAvoid unnecessary code style changes\n\n\n\n\nGit Repository Branching Model\n\n\nWhile the Opencast repository and branching model is inspired by\n\nGitFlow\n, there have been some distinct changes to how release\nbranches are used and releases are tagged. The purpose of this is mainly to support multiple, simultaneous versions and\nmaintenance releases.\n\n\nSwift overview:\n\n\n\n\nThe \ndevelop\n branch represents the latest state of development. Features may be merged into this branch and into\n   this branch only. Release branches are branched off from \ndevelop\n. It is basically the preparation for the next big\n   release at all times.\n\n\nThe release branches are named \nr/<a>.<b>.x\n (e.g. \nr/1.6.x\n). They are the latest state of development for a\n   specific release. Only bug fixes and no features may be added to these branches. All beta versions, release\n   candidates and final releases are made from these branches. The branch lives on as long as there may be additional\n   maintenance releases for a given version.\n\n\nGit tags are created to indicate official releases. These may be:\n\n\nx.y.z-betaX\n marks a beta release. This is usually a version which may still have bugs but is good enough for\n  testing, so that further issues or bugs can be identified before an actual release.\n\n\nx.y.z-rcX\n marks a release candidate. This is a version that seems to be ready to be released as a final\n  version. It will become the final version if testing does not reveal any severe issues.\n\n\nx.y.z\n marks a final release.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo get a closer look at the branching model, let us consider a simple example with a single release:\n\n\ndevelop ---*----*----*------*------- ... -----------*-->\n            \\       /      /                       /\n    r/1.6.x  *-----*------*-------------*---------*----- ... ---*-->\n                           \\             \\         \\             \\\n                1.6.0-beta1 *   1.6.0-rc1 *   1.6.0 *       1.6.1 *\n\n\n\nAs described above, \ndevelop\n is the branch used for preparing the next version. At some point marked in the release\nschedule, the release branch is cut from \ndevelop\n. This action also marks the feature freeze for such Opencast version,\ni.e. the moment when no new features will be included in that specific version. This is because all the new features\nmust be merged only into the \ndevelop\n branch; therefore, the release branches (such as \nr/1.6.x\n in our example) can\nonly contain features that were merged before the branch was forked off. Any features merged after the creation of the\nrelease branch can only make it into the next release, but not into this one.\n\n\nAfter the release branch is cut, the development on the \ndevelop\n branch may continue as before. Features can (and\nshould) be merged without waiting for the next version to be released. Thus, the creation of a release branch also marks\nthe beginning of the development for the next version.\n\n\nIn contrast to that, only bug fixes can be merged in the release branch. At this point, the code contained in this\nbranch should be tested, so that bugs can be identified and fixed. The release manager can tag different beta versions\nduring the QA process (such as \n1.6.0-beta1\n) to mark the code evolution as bug fixes are merged. Once the branch status\nseems to be stable enough to be released, a release candidate (RC) is tagged and tested (\n1.6.0-rc1\n). New RCs can be\ntagged as long as new issues are found and fixed. When no severe issues are found, the final release is tagged.\n\n\nDuring the whole process the release manager will regularly merge back the release branch into \ndevelop\n so that bug\nfixes from the release branch will automatically become part of \ndevelop\n and the next Opencast version, without having\nto create an additional pull request. This is continued until the release branch for the next version is cut.\n\n\nThe releases themselves are not part of the release branch. Instead, the release manager branches off, makes the\nnecessary changes to the pom files (and possibly the UI) and creates a separate tagged commit.\n\n\nFinally, after a release is done, more bug fixes may be added to the release branch. The release manager should identify\nif there are enough commits to be put into a maintenance release.\n\n\nEven after an Opencast version has been released, more bugs may be found and fixes for them merged in the release\nbranch. When the release manager considers that the number or importance of such bug fixes is sufficient, he may decide\nto create a new maintenance release. The version \n1.6.1\n above is an example of that.\n\n\nThe branching structure for multiple versions does not look much more complicated:\n\n\ndevelop  -----*---------*----*------------------------*------>\n               \\       /    / \\                      /\n        r/1.5.x *-----*----*------------*--->       /\n                       \\        \\        \\         /\n                  1.5.0 *        \\  1.5.1 *       /\n                                  \\              /\n                           r/1.6.x *------------*----->\n                                                 \\\n                                            1.6.0 *\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the same principle, the same structure and the same rules apply. The only noteworthy thing is that,\nafter a new release branch is cut, the old release branch will not be merged back into \ndevelop\n. This means that when\na bug fix is relevant to several releases, a different pull request should be created for each of the release branches.\n\n\nRelease Process\n\n\nAs indicated above, the release cycle of a new Opencast version starts when a release branch is cut. The new features\nmerged into \ndevelop\n afterwards will be part of the next version, but not the one just cut.\n\n\nThis is why the position of release manager for the next Opencast version should be assigned at this point. The current\nrelease manager should therefore ask for volunteers in the mailing lists. For more details about the rights and\nresponsibilities of a release manager, please have a look at the \nRelease Manager Guide\n.\n\n\nPreparations\n\n\nThe first phase of the release consists of adding new features and defining the release schedule. It is the duty of the\nrelease manager to orchestrate this. This does not necessarily mean that release managers merge or review pull requests,\nbut that they talk to developers and ensure the merge process is driven forward.\n\n\nRelease Schedule\n\n\nReleases should happen twice a year, usually within a time span of 9.5 months between the cut of the previous release\nbranch and the final release. The release manager should create a release schedule as soon as possible, identifying when\nthe release branch is cut and when the final release will happen. Additionally, he should coordinate with the QA manager\nto identify phases for internal and public testing.\n\n\nUsually a release schedule will look like this:\n\n\nOctober 1st                     Cutting the release branch\nOctober 1st - 22nd              Internal QA phase\nOctober 22nd-November 5th       Public QA phase\nNovember 5th - 26th             Additional bug fixing phase\nNovember 26th - December 10th   Final QA phase (*)\nDecember 15th                   Release of Opencast x.y\n\n\n\n(*) marks the phase where the release is apparently ready to go and has no release blockers left. The additional time is\nto ensure that there is time to fix any serious bug found during this final phase.\n\n\nRelease Branch\n\n\nThe release branch is created from \ndevelop\n. The release branch is named \nr/A.B.x\n (e.g. \nr/2.1.x\n) to indicate that it\nis the origin of all releases with the major and minor version of \nA.B\n. The creation of the release branch marks the\nfeature freeze for a given version, as no more features can be merged into a release branch.\n\n\nTo ensure that all fixes that go into the release branch will become part of \ndevelop\n (and thus part of the next version\nof Opencast) with a minimum amount of work, the release manager will merge the release branch into \ndevelop\n on a\nregular basis. He may request assistance from certain developers in case of merge conflicts. This process continues until\nthe next release branch is cut.\n\n\nTags\n\n\nGit tags are used to mark explicit Opencast versions or releases. Here is how a release should look like in the history:\n\n\nr/A.B.x  ------------(A)---->\n                       \\\n           A.B.0-beta1 (B)\n\n\n\nTo create a version based on a given state of the release branch (commit A), the release manager will branch off from\nthis commit, make the necessary version changes to all \npom.xml\n files and to the UI and create a commit and a \nsigned\n\ngit tag on this commit. He would then push the commit and the tag (not the branch) to the community repository.\n\n\nFore more details about how to create release, have a look at the \nRelease Manager Guide\n.\n\n\nBeta Versions/Release Candidates\n\n\nA beta release (\nA.B.C-betaX\n) should be cut before the public QA phase. It indicates a specific version of Opencast for\nusers to test. It is expected to still have bugs. Beta releases should continue until all bugs with a severity of\n\nBlocker\n have been fixed.\n\n\nIf the code seems to be ready for a release, a \nrelease candidate\n (\nA.B.C-rcX\n) should be cut for final testing. The\ncommit from which a release candidate is created is expected to become the final release if no severe bugs are found.\n\n\nFinal Release\n\n\nOnce a release candidate seems to be stable during the QA phase (no issues left marked as \nBlocker\n), the release manager\nwill propose this release candidate to become the final release. If the proposal is approved (i.e. no serious bugs are\nfound before the proposal deadline is met), the final release is then created from the same commit the\nrelease candidate was cut from.\n\n\nMaintenance Releases\n\n\nAfter a final release, additional issues may show up. These issues may be fixed on the ongoing release branch and at\nsome point released as maintenance release.\n\n\nThere is usually no release schedule for maintenance releases. It is up to the release manager to decide when it is\nworthwhile to create a maintenance release with the fixes for bugs affecting a given release. He would then announce his\nintention to create such a release, cut a release candidate and, should no severe issues with this candidate show up, cut\nthe maintenance release.\n\n\nQuality Assurance\n\n\nAs any piece of software, Opencast may contain bugs. It is the duty of the whole community to identify these bugs,\nreport them and possibly fix them to improve Opencast as product.\n\n\nAdditionally, before releasing a new version of Opencast, the current release manager and quality assurance manager will\ncoordinate test phases dedicated to new releases in order to identify possible problems ahead of time. The whole\ncommunity will be requested to participate in this testing.\n\n\nReporting Bugs\n\n\nIf you identify any bugs, please report them! To do that, register yourself in the \nOpencast\nJira\n and create a new ticket. Please describe in detail how to reproduce the problem and\nespecially set the \nAffects Version\n and \"Fix Version\", where \nFix Version\n should be the next Opencast release.\n\n\nIf in doubt of any items in the ticket, please assign it for review to either the current release manager or to the\nquality assurance manager. They will check the issue fields and adjust \nfix version\n, \nseverity\n, etc. if necessary.\n\n\nSecurity Issues\n\n\nIf you discover a problem that has severe implications for system security, please do not publish these information on\nlist. Instead, send a report of the problem to \nsecurity@opencast.org\n. The message will be forwarded to the private\ncommitters list, where the issue will be discussed. Once a patch for the problem is ready, a security notice will be\nreleased along with it.\n\n\nUnit Tests\n\n\nAll Opencast modules should have built-in unit tests to check that they are actually doing what they are supposed to do\nand that code patches do not break the existing functionality. These tests are automatically run whenever the project is\nbuilt. If building repeatedly fails due to test failures, then something is most likely wrong. Please report this as a\nsevere bug.\n\n\nUser Tests\n\n\nBefore each major release, the release and quality assurance managers will ask the whole community to participate in\nthe execution of a set of manual tests. These tests are designed to check that important functionalities of Opencast\nwork as expected even if users are in slightly different environments or choose different methods to achieve a certain\ngoal.\n\n\nSuch a call for participation will usually be raised both on the lists, the technical and the adopters meeting.  If it\nis possible for you to participate, please do so. Identifying possible problems early will immensely benefit the release\nprocess.\n\n\nTest Server\n\n\nSome institutions provide public testing infrastructure for Opencast. Use them to try out the most recent development\nversion of Opencast. They are meant for testing. Do not fear to break them.  If you manage to do it, please contact the\nQA manager or send a notice to the list.\n\n\nRemember that they are usually not running a stable version of Opencast but the latest development release (beta version\nor release candidate) instead. If you discover any bugs on these systems, please take a minute to report them.",

It is important to note that, while the release manager drives the release process, the\ncommitter body is in charge of both the work and the decision making, meaning that votes and successful proposals from\nthis body take precedence over a release managers decision.\n\n\nThe release manager does not have to be a committer. In case the release manager is not, a committer must agree to be\nthe proxy release manager for communication on the confidential committers list.\n\n\nA release manager can abandon the release at any time, giving up their duties and privileges of being the release\nmanager. The committer list must then either vote within 72 hours on a new release manager, or consider the release\nabandoned (the major, minor, and maintenance numbers remain unchanged).\n\n\nDuties\n\n\nSetting Release Schedule\n\n\nReleases should happen twice a year, usually within a time span of 9.5 months between the cut of the previous release\nbranch and the final release. The release manager should create a release schedule as soon as possible.\nFor more details about the release schedule, have a look at the \nDevelopment Process\n\n\nCreation of Release Branch\n\n\nAccording to the set release schedule, at one point a release branch should be cut, effectively marking a feature freeze\nfor a given release.\n\n\nOnce a release process has started, a branch should be created with the proposed version number of that release. This\nbranch is created off of \ndevelop\n and should be named \nr/X.Y.x\n (e.g. \nr/2.1.x\n for the Opencast 2.1 release branch).\nIn the following command, we assume that the release branch for 2.1 is to be created. For other versions, please adjust\nthe version number accordingly.\n\n\nCreate the Branch:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrab the merge ticket for \ndevelop\n. You are going to make changes there and it becomes ugly if someone else changes\n   something at the same time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out \ndevelop\n and make sure it has the latest state (replace \n<remote>\n with your remote name for the community\n   repository):\n\n\ngit checkout develop\ngit pull <remote> develop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate and push release branch:\n\n\ngit checkout -b r/2.1.x\ngit push <remote> r/2.1.x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure you did not modify any files. If you did, stash those changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is it for the release branch. Now lets make sure we update the versions in \ndevelop\n in preparation for the next\n   release:\n\n\ngit checkout develop\nfor i in `find . -name pom.xml`; do \\\n  sed -i 's/<version>2.1-SNAPSHOT<!--<version-->2.2-SNAPSHOT<!--' $i; done\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave a look at the changes. Make sure no library version we use has the version \n2.1-SNAPSHOT\n and was accidentally\n   changed. Also make sure that nothing else was modified:\n\n\ngit diff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck again for unwanted changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf everything looks fine, commit everything and push it to the community repository:\n\n\ngit commit -as\ngit push <remote--> develop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally change the \nfixVersion\n and \nsummary\n on the merge ticket for 2.1 and create a new one for develop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, the developer community should then be notified. Consider using the following as a template email:\n\n\nTo: matterhorn@opencast.org\nSubject: Release Branch for Opencast <VERSION> Cut\n\nHi everyone,\nit is my pleasure to announce that the <VERSION> release branch has now been\ncut, available as r/<VERSION>. Pull requests for bug fixes are to be made\nagainst this branch.\n\nRemember that the release schedule for this release:\n\n  <RELEASE_SCHEDULE>\n\nAs always, we hope to have a lot of people testing this version, especially\nduring the public QA phase.  Please report any bugs or issues you encounter.\n\n\n\nAdjust Pull Request Filter\n\n\nThe \nOpencast pull request filter\n links the versions currently in development. The\nmerge ticket identifier needs to be added to that filter. As release manager, please talk to the \nadministrator\n\n of that tool to ensure the ticket is added.\n\n\nRelease Documentation\n\n\nThe \nOpencast release documentation\n will be built automatically from available release tags.\nHowever, new branches need to be included.  As release manager, please talk to the \nadministrator\n\n of that\ntool to ensure the ticket is added.\n\n\nModeration of Peer Reviews\n\n\nApart from creating branches and tags, one of the most important things for release managers to do is to ensure that\npull requests for the release are going forward. This does not mean that the release manager has to do the reviews, but\nhe should talk to developers, remind them about outstanding reviews and help to resolve possible issues.\n\n\nMerging Release Branch Into Develop\n\n\nTo not have to merge bug fixes into several branches and create several pull requests, the release manager should merge\nthe release branch back into \ndevelop\n on a regular basis. It is encouraged to do that frequently, to not let the\nbranches diverge too much and to avoid possible merge conflicts.\n\n\nTo merge the release branch into \ndevelop\n. As example, we do that for 2.1. Please adjust the version accordingly:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrab the merge ticket for \ndevelop\n. You are not doing any changes to the release branch, so you will not need that\n   merge ticket. If someone else holds the merge ticket for a feature pull request, talk to that person that you will\n   temporarily steal the ticket.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate release branch:\n\n\ngit checkout r/2.1.x\ngit pull <remote> r/2.1.x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate \ndevelop\n:\n\n\ngit checkout develop\ngit pull <remote> develop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMerge the release branch. Not that if large merge conflicts arise, you may ask for help from the people creating the\n   problematic patches:\n\n\ngit merge r/2.1.x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPush updated branch into the community repository:\n\n\ngit push <remote> develop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave a comment in the merge ticket and assign it back to the next pull request in line on \ndevelop\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeta Versions and Release Candidates\n\n\nFor testing purposes, the release manager should regularly create beta versions. Especially before the public QA phase,\na beta version should exist. Additionally, he should create a release candidate for testing before proposing that a\nrelease be cut.\n\n\nCreate a version/tag. Again, version 2.1 is used as example.

I was surprised, because thought we had\npreviously implemented a checkstyle rule which would have banned those \nstatements!  I hereby #propose that we implement the changes outlined in \nhttps://opencast.jira.com/browse/MH-11222, and remove these statements in \nfavour of logger statements.  I also propose that we add this rule to the \ncheckstyle ruleset so that we don't have to deal with this again going \nforward.  Proposal closes EOD 2016-02-03.\n\nG\n\n\n\nHow to release a new Opencast version\u2026\n\n\nProposed by Lars Kiesow \nlkiesow@uos.de\n, passed on Fri, 14 Aug 2015 12:54:51 UTC\n\n\nHi everyone,\nserving as co-release manager for two versions of Opencast, I noticed\nthat our current release process has some aspects of the release defined\nin a way that is more hindering than helpful and I want to #propose a\nslight change to these recommendations.\n\nI hereby #propose:\n\n1. Get rid of the `master` branch, make `develop` the main branch.\n2. Do not use the --no-ff flags for merges\n3. Do not create versions/tags in a release branch. Separate them.\n\n\nReasoning:\n\n1. The short explanation whould be: When did you explicitely checked\n   out `master` last time? People rarely do that. If I want a specific\n   version, I use the tag, if not I want the release branch or\n   `develop`.\n   If you think about it, then the whole reason for `master` in GitFlow\n   is to always provide the last stable version to users who just check\n   out the repository and do nothing else. The problem with Opencast is,\n   that we support multiple versions at the same time. If in a couple\n   of weeks 1.6.2 is being released, it is the latest stable. Is it? If\n   I check out `master`, however, I will still get 2.0 as we cannot\n   merge 1.6.x afterwards. While you can grasp the reasons behind this,\n   it is a bit confusing for users and it is much easier to just tell\n   them to use the tag to check out a specific version.\n   That it, if they do not use the tarballs from BitBucket anyway.\n\n2. First of all, most people seem to be using BitBucket for\n   auto-merging and it does not use --no-ff. So we are not really\n   consistent anyway. Being consistent and using  --no-ff would mean to\n   forbid the usage of the BitBucket merge.\n   Second, have a look at the confusing mess that are the current\n   branches (I tried to find something in the visualization a while ago\n   but gave up). It would be much cleaner to try using fast-forward\n   merges. So instead of using non-fast-forward commits I would argue\n   that we should instead try to use as many fast-forward commits as\n   possible.\n\n3. Once we decided to have the tags in our branches like this:\n\n      ---- A ---- B (tagged) ----- C ---- D -->\n\n   A is the commit containing the version that is decided to be\n   released. B is the tagged version. It is exactly the same code as A\n   except for the pom.xml versions that are modified. Finally C then\n   reverts B as the modified version should not be part of the release\n   branch, .... After C, the code is basically A again except for the\n   history (which we later need to merge which can be problematic). D\n   would then be the next \u201creal\u201d commit, meaning the next fix.\n\n   Much easier to handle would be the following structure:\n\n     ---- A ---- D -->\n           \\\n            B (tagged)\n\n   You do not have to revert that commit, you do not need to merge the\n   easily conflicting pom.xml changes and in the end, you would anyway\n   check out the tag using  git checkout <tag>  if you want that\n   specific version\n\n\nBranching structure:\n\nTo have a complete overview, this is what the new branching structure\nwould look like:\n\n\n  develop --*--*--*--*--*----*--------*--------*---->\n                   \\        /                 /\n            r/x.y.z *--*--*---*--*--*--*--*--*---->\n                           \\                  \\\n                            * x.y.z-beta1      * x.y.z-rc1\n\nRegards,\nLars\n\n\n\nMoving away from the 3rd party scripts\n\n\nProposed by Greg Logan \ngregorydlogan@gmail.com\n, passed by Fri, 24 Jul 2015 16:45:40 UTC\n\n\nHi folks,\n\nAs it stands right now we depend on the 3rd party tool script to\ninstall a great many of our 3rd party dependencies.  These are\nutilities like tesseract, ffmpeg, sox, etc.  This script is maintained\nby Matjaz, in his own time.  I'd like to take a moment to thank him\nfor a doing a great job on a particularly annoying aspect of\nsupporting our work!  I know it hasn't been easy, especially\nsupporting vast number of different OS versions!\n\nWith the release of 2.0 I noticed that our 3rd party tool script is\nbecoming both a little out of date, and difficult to maintain.  I took\na quick look around and it seems like *most* of our dependencies are\navailable from normal distribution repositories for Debian based\nsystems, and I'm told that there is a similar situation for Redhat\nbased systems.  I am unsure of how many of our users are running\nMatterhorn on Mac, but I would hope that our developers who are\nworking on Mac would be able to provide instructions and/or binaries\nfor those users.  The only dependency where there might be a universal\nsticking point is ffmpeg (due to patent concerns), however ffmpeg\nbuilds a full static binary with each release, so I assume we can\neither depend on this and/or cache them somewhere.\n\nWhat this means is that we can potentially remove the 3rd party script\nfrom our repository.  I hereby #propose we find a way to do that,\nwhich would remove the 3rd party script from the repository and\nreplace it with a number of new steps in the install documentation.\n\nG\n\n\n\nStatus of youtube in 2.0 and #proposal to change the default workflow\n\n\nProposed by R\u00fcdiger Rolf \nrrolf@Uni-Osnabrueck.DE\n, passed on Sat, 13 Jun 2015 14:15:55 UTC\n\n\nHi list!\n\nThere was some discussion in the DevOps meeting yesterday if the\nYoutube distribution would work or not. I offered to check this.\n\nThe good news first: IT WORKS!\nJust follow this manual and your Matterhorn - ups Opencast -  is ready\nto distribute to Youtube.\n\n  http://docs.opencast.org/r/2.0.x/admin/modules/youtubepublication/\n\nThe bad news: The default workflow definition does not really support\nthe publishing on Youtube, as only one video file could be published\nby the current WOH.\n\n  https://opencast.jira.com/browse/MH-10920\n\nThe reason is simple and the fix would be too. But there are some\noptions to fix this:\n\n1. Remove the option to distribute to Youtube from the default workflow\n   definition, as the complicated configuration would have to come\n   first anyway.\n2. Only let \"presenter\" or \"presentation\" be published to Youtube. We\n   would need a new youtube tag and add this to the compose operation\n   and the youtube operation.\n3. Introduce the composite operation to the workflow definition and\n   publish only the resulting single stream to Youtube.\n4.

An issue that exposes a\nknow long time ambiguity regarding metadata and the ingest service.\nThe reason that its a proposal is that it normalizes the handling of\ninbound episode catalog metadata in the ingest service.\n\n\n1) A new configuration parameter, boolean, for the Ingest Service. The\n   config param identifies if episode metadata precedence is for\n   Ingestee (i.e. Opencast system) or the Ingester (i.e. Capture\n   Agent).\n\n   For example: at our site, the scheduling entity is the metadata\n   authority. All updates are made to the Scheduling endpoint. The\n   Capture Agent always has stale episode catalog metadata. At other\n   sites, updates are made on the Capture Agent directly. The\n   community default can be for priority to the Capture Agent.\n\n2) All Ingest endpoints perform the same consistent process to ensure\n   that an episode catalog will exist, manually or automatically\n   provided.\n\n3) The process performs the following...\n\n3.1. Gather data\n\n - Check if inbound media package contain a reference to an Episode\n   DublinCore catalog and if that catalog contains a title.\n - Check if the inbound media package contains a title attribute.\n - Check if the Workflow service has a reference to the mediapackage's\n   Episode Dublin Core catalog\n - Check if the Scheduler service retained a reference to the event's\n   Episode Dublin Core catalog\n\n3.2. Use config param to prioritize action on acquiring an Episode dc\n   catalog for the media package\n\n  If Capture Agent metadata takes precedence:\n     - Take the inbound Episode dc catalog, if it exists\n     - Take the Episode dc catalog from the workflow service, if it\n       exists\n     - Take the Episode dc  catalog from the scheduler service, if it\n       exists\n     - Create an Episode dc catalog from the title in the media\n       package,, if it exists\n     - Create an Episode dc catalog using a default title (i.e.\n       \"Recording-1234556XYZ\")\n\n If Opencast metadata takes precedence:\n     - Take the Episode dc catalog from the workflow service, if it\n       exists\n     - Take the Episode dc  catalog from the scheduler service, if it\n       exists\n     - Take the inbound Episode dc catalog if it exists\n     - Create an Episode dc catalog from the title in the media\n       package, if it exists\n     - Create an Episode dc catalog using a default title (i.e.\n       \"Recording-1234556XYZ\")\n\nI'll start a pull for the above, and appreciate any thoughts.\n\nRegards,\nKaren\n\n[1] https://opencast.jira.com/browse/MH-10821\n\n\n\nDropping Taglines\n\n\nProposed by  Greg Logan \ngregorydlogan@gmail.com\n, Passed on Fri, 29 May 2015 16:19:09 UTC\n\n\nHi folks,\n\nI hereby propose that we drop the practice of having taglines.

When I had a look at the wikis we\ncurrently have I noticed that most of our 17(!) wikis have not been\ntouched in years and can probably go away.\n\nHere is a list of our wikis and what I #propose to do with/to them:\n\nKeep (maybe clean-up a bit):\n - Matterhorn Adopter Guides\n - Matterhorn Developer Wiki\n - Opencast Matterhorn D/A/CH\n - Opencast Matterhorn Espa\u00f1ol\n - LectureSight\n\nExport as PDF to archive the contents and then delete:\n - Matterhorn Release Docs - 1.0\n - Matterhorn Release Docs - 1.1\n - Matterhorn Release Docs - 1.2\n - Matterhorn Release Docs - 1.3\n - Matterhorn Release Docs - 1.4\n - Matterhorn Release Docs - 1.5\n - Matterhorn Release Docs - TRUNK\n\nKeep until 2.1 is out then export as PDF and delete:\n - Matterhorn Release Docs - 1.6\n\nJust delete:\n - Analytic video annotation\n - Infra\n - Matterhorn Documents\n - Opencast Community\n\n\nPlease let me know if you agree or disagree with this proposal.\n\nRegards,\nLars\n\n[1] http://documentation.opencast.org\n\n\n\nJira Clean-Up\n\n\nProposed by Lars Kiesow \nlkiesow@uos.de\n, Passed on Fri, 8 May 2015 11:52:16 UTC\n\n\nHi everyone,\nas discussed in the technical meeting, I hereby #propose:\n\n  The \u201cBlocker\u201d and \u201cRelease Blocker\u201d severity status are more or less\n  redundant. As part of cleaning up Jira, let us remove the \u201cRelease\n  Blocker\u201d severity in favor of \u201cBlocker\u201d.\n\nAs footnote, some statistics: Since the beginning of 2014, 70 Release\nBlockers have been files in Jira while mere *8* Blockers have been\nfiles.\n\nRegards,\nLars\n\n\n\nOpencast Documentation\n\n\nProposed by R\u00fcdiger Rolf \nrrolf@uni-osnabrueck.de\n, Passed on Sat, 02 May 2015 14:43:28 UTC\n\n\nHi all,\n\nTobias, Basil, Lars and I discussed status of the current migration of\nthe Opencast (Matterhorn) documentation to GIT. We still see some open\nissues that need clarification so we would like to propose the\nfollowing points:\n\n*1. Formating and Hosting of the Documentation *\n\nWe want to use https://readthedocs.org to or a similar service create\na more appealing HTML version from the Markdown of the documentation.\n\nThe documentation will be versioned there so that for older versions\nthe documentation is still available. By default the \"latest\" version\nis shown.  The versions of the documenation will be generated based on\nthe release branches.\n\n*2. Structure of the Documentation*\n\nWe see the documentation in*Git *separating into 3 sections:\n\n - /Administration Guide/: with information about the installation,\n   configuration, customization and integration. This will be the part\n   of information by an administrator to setup\n   Opencast.\n\n - /Developer Guide/: All information related to implementation\n   details of Opencast, so that this will be updated in a pull request\n   (API changes, module descriptions, architecture). The development\n   process documents should also go here as only committers usually\n   should change these.\n\n - /User Guide/: Documentation of the (new) Admin UI that was already\n   started by Entwine and the Engage UI (especially Theodul Player).\n   This guide should only describe options available on the UIs.\n\nWithin the *Wiki* we still see the need for 2 sections:\n\n - /Developer Wiki/: Proposals, working documents and meeting notes\n   will be kept here so that anybody can edit these. So information\n   not to close to any existing implementation that might still be in\n   a process of discussion can be found here.\n\n - /Adopters Wiki/: This can be the place where adopters share their\n   best practises, configurations, hardware recommendations,\n   third-party software documentation etc. Again anyone can contribute\n   to this wiki.\n\nThe difference between the Wiki and Git is in the first line that the\nGit documentation should become a quality assured ressource for\nOpencast users. The Git documentation should be reviewed within the\nrelease process and it will be part of the review process of a pull\nrequest, to make sure that the needed documentation changes have been\ncontributed too.\n\nThe Wikis on the other hand should be a more open platform where\neverybody can contribute and users might find cookbooks to enhance\ntheir system, or they can share ideas.\n\nSo now we would like to get your opinion on this proposal.\n\nThank you,\nR\u00fcdiger\n\n\n\nRequirement Specification\n\n\nProposed by Lars Kiesow \nlkiesow@uos.de\n, Passed on Thu, 16 Apr 2015 15:55:31 UTC\n\n\nOn list or IRC we often see that people do not really know the current\nrequirements for a specific version of Opencast Matterhorn. Of course\nthere are the pom.xml files specifying internal dependencies, but there\nis nothing for 3rd-party-tools, ...\n\nIt would be nice to add a file specifying these requirements in a\nformat that is easy to parse and can hence be used for automatic\nscripts to generate dependency lists, ...\n\nThat is why I hereby #propose to add a requirements.xml file that\nspecifies the requirements for Opencast Matterhorn:\n - Required tools including versions\n - Which modules require which tools\n - Which modules conflict with each other (negative requirement)\n\nThis is mainly what is not specified by the pom.xml files yet.\n\n\n\nJira Clean-Up (Tags VS Labels)\n\n\nProposed by Lars Kiesow \nlkiesow@uos.de\n, Passed on Thu, 19. Mar 2015 15:43:20 UTC\n\n\n\u2026then hereby I officially #propose removing the labels from Jira.\n\n\n\nFor more details, have a look at the mail thread at:\n\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/a/opencast.org/forum/#!topic/matterhorn/vIdWQkZmbdQ\n\n\n\nFFmpeg Update\n\n\nProposed by Lars Kiesow \nlkiesow@uos.de\n, Passed on Sat, 14 Mar 2015 22:12:18 UTC\n\n\nLooking at the FFmpeg project for the last two years, you will notice\nthat they developed a pretty stable release cycle with a release of a\nnew stable version approximately every three month.\n\nTo stop us from having to propose an update again and again, I hereby\npropose the following general rule for our support of FFmpeg:\n\n  A Matterhorn release will oficially support the latest stable\n  version of FFmpeg released at the time the release branch is cut and\n  all other FFmpeg versions with the same major version number released\n  afterwards.\n\nFor example, for Matterhorn 2 this would mean that we will officially\nsupport FFmpeg 2.5.4 and all later 2.x versions like 2.6 which has\nbeen released on the 7th of March or a possible 2.7 onece it is\nreleased. We would, however, not necessarily support an FFmpeg 3 as it\n*might* come with an interface change that *could* break compatibility.\n\nThat obviously does not mean that older versions of FFmpeg just stop\nworking. In fact, most parts of the default Matterhorn configuration\nshould at the moment still work with FFmpeg 1.x but we will not test or\nfix compatibility problems.\n\n\n\nProposal Log\n\n\nProposed by Lars Kiesow \nlkiesow@uos.de\n, Passed on Sat, 14 Mar 2015 16:35:08 UTC\n\n\nIt would be wonderful if we had a central place to look up the proposals\nthat have passed.\n\nThat is why I hereby propose that:\n\n - We create a proposal log in our new documentation containing all\n   proposals that have passed on list.\n\n - A proposal will become effective only after it is written down in\n   that log. That should usually be done by the person who sent out\n   that proposal.\n\nThis will, of course, not affect the existing decision making rules\n(proposal on list, marked with #proposal, lazy consensus after three\ndays, no -1, ...)",

            "text": "Proposed by Lars Kiesow  lkiesow@uos.de , passed on Fri, 14 Aug 2015 12:54:51 UTC  Hi everyone,\nserving as co-release manager for two versions of Opencast, I noticed\nthat our current release process has some aspects of the release defined\nin a way that is more hindering than helpful and I want to #propose a\nslight change to these recommendations.\n\nI hereby #propose:\n\n1. Get rid of the `master` branch, make `develop` the main branch.\n2. Do not use the --no-ff flags for merges\n3. Do not create versions/tags in a release branch. Separate them.\n\n\nReasoning:\n\n1. The short explanation whould be: When did you explicitely checked\n   out `master` last time? People rarely do that. If I want a specific\n   version, I use the tag, if not I want the release branch or\n   `develop`.\n   If you think about it, then the whole reason for `master` in GitFlow\n   is to always provide the last stable version to users who just check\n   out the repository and do nothing else. The problem with Opencast is,\n   that we support multiple versions at the same time. If in a couple\n   of weeks 1.6.2 is being released, it is the latest stable. Is it? If\n   I check out `master`, however, I will still get 2.0 as we cannot\n   merge 1.6.x afterwards. While you can grasp the reasons behind this,\n   it is a bit confusing for users and it is much easier to just tell\n   them to use the tag to check out a specific version.\n   That it, if they do not use the tarballs from BitBucket anyway.\n\n2. First of all, most people seem to be using BitBucket for\n   auto-merging and it does not use --no-ff. So we are not really\n   consistent anyway. Being consistent and using  --no-ff would mean to\n   forbid the usage of the BitBucket merge.\n   Second, have a look at the confusing mess that are the current\n   branches (I tried to find something in the visualization a while ago\n   but gave up). It would be much cleaner to try using fast-forward\n   merges. So instead of using non-fast-forward commits I would argue\n   that we should instead try to use as many fast-forward commits as\n   possible.\n\n3. Once we decided to have the tags in our branches like this:\n\n      ---- A ---- B (tagged) ----- C ---- D -->\n\n   A is the commit containing the version that is decided to be\n   released. B is the tagged version. It is exactly the same code as A\n   except for the pom.xml versions that are modified. Finally C then\n   reverts B as the modified version should not be part of the release\n   branch, .... After C, the code is basically A again except for the\n   history (which we later need to merge which can be problematic). D\n   would then be the next \u201creal\u201d commit, meaning the next fix.\n\n   Much easier to handle would be the following structure:\n\n     ---- A ---- D -->\n           \\\n            B (tagged)\n\n   You do not have to revert that commit, you do not need to merge the\n   easily conflicting pom.xml changes and in the end, you would anyway\n   check out the tag using  git checkout <tag>  if you want that\n   specific version\n\n\nBranching structure:\n\nTo have a complete overview, this is what the new branching structure\nwould look like:\n\n\n  develop --*--*--*--*--*----*--------*--------*---->\n                   \\        /                 /\n            r/x.y.z *--*--*---*--*--*--*--*--*---->\n                           \\                  \\\n                            * x.y.z-beta1      * x.y.z-rc1\n\nRegards,\nLars",

These are\nutilities like tesseract, ffmpeg, sox, etc.  This script is maintained\nby Matjaz, in his own time.  I'd like to take a moment to thank him\nfor a doing a great job on a particularly annoying aspect of\nsupporting our work!  I know it hasn't been easy, especially\nsupporting vast number of different OS versions!\n\nWith the release of 2.0 I noticed that our 3rd party tool script is\nbecoming both a little out of date, and difficult to maintain.  I took\na quick look around and it seems like *most* of our dependencies are\navailable from normal distribution repositories for Debian based\nsystems, and I'm told that there is a similar situation for Redhat\nbased systems.  I am unsure of how many of our users are running\nMatterhorn on Mac, but I would hope that our developers who are\nworking on Mac would be able to provide instructions and/or binaries\nfor those users.  The only dependency where there might be a universal\nsticking point is ffmpeg (due to patent concerns), however ffmpeg\nbuilds a full static binary with each release, so I assume we can\neither depend on this and/or cache them somewhere.\n\nWhat this means is that we can potentially remove the 3rd party script\nfrom our repository.

When I had a look at the wikis we\ncurrently have I noticed that most of our 17(!) wikis have not been\ntouched in years and can probably go away.\n\nHere is a list of our wikis and what I #propose to do with/to them:\n\nKeep (maybe clean-up a bit):\n - Matterhorn Adopter Guides\n - Matterhorn Developer Wiki\n - Opencast Matterhorn D/A/CH\n - Opencast Matterhorn Espa\u00f1ol\n - LectureSight\n\nExport as PDF to archive the contents and then delete:\n - Matterhorn Release Docs - 1.0\n - Matterhorn Release Docs - 1.1\n - Matterhorn Release Docs - 1.2\n - Matterhorn Release Docs - 1.3\n - Matterhorn Release Docs - 1.4\n - Matterhorn Release Docs - 1.5\n - Matterhorn Release Docs - TRUNK\n\nKeep until 2.1 is out then export as PDF and delete:\n - Matterhorn Release Docs - 1.6\n\nJust delete:\n - Analytic video annotation\n - Infra\n - Matterhorn Documents\n - Opencast Community\n\n\nPlease let me know if you agree or disagree with this proposal.\n\nRegards,\nLars\n\n[1] http://documentation.opencast.org",

We still see some open\nissues that need clarification so we would like to propose the\nfollowing points:\n\n*1. Formating and Hosting of the Documentation *\n\nWe want to use https://readthedocs.org to or a similar service create\na more appealing HTML version from the Markdown of the documentation.\n\nThe documentation will be versioned there so that for older versions\nthe documentation is still available. By default the \"latest\" version\nis shown.  The versions of the documenation will be generated based on\nthe release branches.\n\n*2. Structure of the Documentation*\n\nWe see the documentation in*Git *separating into 3 sections:\n\n - /Administration Guide/: with information about the installation,\n   configuration, customization and integration. This will be the part\n   of information by an administrator to setup\n   Opencast.\n\n - /Developer Guide/: All information related to implementation\n   details of Opencast, so that this will be updated in a pull request\n   (API changes, module descriptions, architecture). The development\n   process documents should also go here as only committers usually\n   should change these.\n\n - /User Guide/: Documentation of the (new) Admin UI that was already\n   started by Entwine and the Engage UI (especially Theodul Player).\n   This guide should only describe options available on the UIs.\n\nWithin the *Wiki* we still see the need for 2 sections:\n\n - /Developer Wiki/: Proposals, working documents and meeting notes\n   will be kept here so that anybody can edit these. So information\n   not to close to any existing implementation that might still be in\n   a process of discussion can be found here.\n\n - /Adopters Wiki/: This can be the place where adopters share their\n   best practises, configurations, hardware recommendations,\n   third-party software documentation etc. Again anyone can contribute\n   to this wiki.\n\nThe difference between the Wiki and Git is in the first line that the\nGit documentation should become a quality assured ressource for\nOpencast users. The Git documentation should be reviewed within the\nrelease process and it will be part of the review process of a pull\nrequest, to make sure that the needed documentation changes have been\ncontributed too.\n\nThe Wikis on the other hand should be a more open platform where\neverybody can contribute and users might find cookbooks to enhance\ntheir system, or they can share ideas.\n\nSo now we would like to get your opinion on this proposal.\n\nThank you,\nR\u00fcdiger",

We would, however, not necessarily support an FFmpeg 3 as it\n*might* come with an interface change that *could* break compatibility.\n\nThat obviously does not mean that older versions of FFmpeg just stop\nworking.

The Opencast project has several\nNexus servers located around the world. For an up-to-date list of servers as well as their current status and your\nautomatic selection, have a look at the \nNexus GeoIP Redirect Service\n.\n\n\nGeoIP Server Set-up\n\n\nThe main entry point for retrieving artifacts is nexus.opencast.org, which runs a \nGeoIP based Gateway service\n\n to probe which Nexus server is likely the best to use for that request and\nthen redirects the request accordingly.\n\n\nThe Nexus servers are configured to retrieve and cache artifacts from:\n\n\n\n\nApache Snapshots\n\n\nCodehaus Snapshots\n\n\nMaven Central\n\n\nOpencast Master\n\n\n\n\nOpencast Master\n is a special repository pointing to the \nOpencast Nexus server hosted at the University of Osnabr\u00fcck\n\n.

To run an Opencast Nexus using Docker,\nfollow these steps:\n\n\ndocker pull lkiesow/opencast-nexus-oss\ndocker run \\\n   --name opencast-nexus-oss \\\n   -p 8081:8081 \\\n  -v /place/for/nexus/data/on/host/machine:/var/lib/nexus-oss \\\n  lkiesow/opencast-nexus-oss\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \n-p\n option will map the internal port of the Nexus server in Docker to the port on the host machine.\n\n\nThe \n-v\n option will mount the folder \n/place/for/nexus/data\n from the Docker host machine to \n/var/lib/nexus-oss\n\n  container. This will keep all your runtime data our of the container and you can then later upgrade to a new Nexus\n  version by just getting a new container.\n\n\n\n\nMake sure to log-in and change the password for the user \nadmin\n as soon as your Nexus is running. To do that, head to\n\nhttp://localhost:8081/nexus\n and log-in as user \nadmin\n using the password \nadmin123\n.\n\n\nUpdate Using Docker\n\n\nIf you followed the set-up guide above, the main configuration, along with all the Nexus data is stored on the host\nmachine. Hence we just need to get the latest Docker image and replace the Nexus container:\n\n\ndocker rm -f opencast-nexus-oss\ndocker pull lkiesow/opencast-nexus-oss\ndocker run \\\n   --name opencast-nexus-oss \\\n   -p 8081:8081 \\\n  -v /place/for/nexus/data/on/host/machine:/var/lib/nexus-oss \\\n  lkiesow/opencast-nexus-oss\n\n\n\nSet-up Using RPMs\n\n\nFor Nexus-OSS, there is a \nFedora Copr repository available\n\nfor CentOS/RHEL 7.x and the latest Fedora versions. You can use these to easily istall Nexus.\n\n\nFirst, enable the repository. For CentOS/RHEL 7.x this would be:\n\n\ncurl -o /etc/yum.repos.d/lkiesow-nexus-oss-epel-7.repo \\\n  https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/lkiesow/nexus-oss/repo/epel-7/lkiesow-nexus-oss-epel-7.repo\n\n\n\nThen istall Nexus-OSS:\n\n\nyum install nexus-oss\n\n\n\nDownload the \nconfiguration file\n and place it in \n/var/lib/nexus-oss/conf/\n:\n\n\nmkdir -p /var/lib/nexus-oss/conf/\ncp nexus.xml /var/lib/nexus-oss/conf/nexus.xml\n\n\n\nFinally, activate the service:\n\n\nsystemctl start nexus-oss\nsystemctl enable nexus-oss\n\n\n\nMake sure to log-in and change the password for the user \nadmin\n as soon as your Nexus is running. To do that, head to\n\nhttp://localhost:8081/nexus\n and log-in as user \nadmin\n using the password \nadmin123\n.\n\n\nUse a Specific Opencast Nexus\n\n\nIf you did set-up a local Nexus repository you can add a custom Maven configuration to overwrite the global nexus server\nsettings. To do that, create a user specific Maven settings file in \n~/.m2/settings.xml\n like this:\n\n\n<settings xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0\"\n  xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n  xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0\n  http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd\">\n  <profiles>\n    <profile>\n      <id>set-opencast-nexus</id>\n      <properties>\n        <opencast.nexus.url>http://nexus.example.com</opencast.nexus.url>\n      </properties>\n    </profile>\n  </profiles>\n  <activeProfiles>\n    <activeProfile>set-opencast-nexus</activeProfile>\n  </activeProfiles>\n</settings>\n\n\n\nThis will let Maven overwrite the \nopencast.nexus.url\n property used by Opencast to determine the Nexus server during\nthe build process.",
