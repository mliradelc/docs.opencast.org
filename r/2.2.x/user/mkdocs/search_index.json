            "text": "Role-Based Visibility\n\n\nOpencast supports a powerful mechanism that allows to provide users selective access to the administrative user\ninterface. Using that mechanism, it is possible to configure what parts of the UI (and therefore functionality)\nare visibile to a given user based on the user's roles. Hence, we call that mechanism role-based visibility.\n\n\nHow To Use\n\n\nThe best practise to assign a larger set of roles to a user is to use Opencast's support for user groups. This\nway, you can define a group whose roles provide access to the parts of the UI you want to provide access to. Given\nsuch a group, you can just add users to that group and they will get all the roles of the group which includes\nroles that allow the users to access specific parts of the UI.\n\n\nPlease consult the \nGroups section\n for information about adding new groups.\n\n\nThere is a set of so-called user interface roles, each of them providing access to a specific part of the \nadministrative user interface. Those roles can be easily identified by their name prefix \nROLE_UI\n.\n\n\nImportant\n \nROLE_ADMIN\n implicitly provides full access to the user interface. When working with role-based\nvisibility, users (and the groups they belong to) may not have \nROLE_ADMIN\n therefore.\n\n\nUser Interface Roles\n\n\nThis section describes which roles permit access to what parts of the user interface. Note that role-based visibility\nis not just hiding graphical elements from users, it does also protect server-side resources from unauthorized access\nif necessary.\n\n\nIt is important to understand that the UI roles are not coupled, i.e. having a particular role does not imply any other\npermission than the one exactly provided by the role.\n\n\nExample: Just having the role \nROLE_UI_NAV_CAPTURE_VIEW\n won't display the navigation menu. This requires the role\n\nROLE_UI_NAV\n, too.\n\n\nThe advantage of having independent roles is that it makes role-based visibility even more flexible, For example, it is\npossible to not use the navigation menu at all. The drawback of this approach is that it makes configuration more\nadvanced. But configuring role-based visibility is not a daily tasks.\n\n\nGeneral Access\n\n\nImportant:\n \nROLE_ADMIN_UI\n is required for accessing the admin ui in general in means of providing access to\nsome often used resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRole\n\n\nUser Interface\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nROLE_ADMIN_UI\n\n\nAllow user to access login page as well as commonly used resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation Menu\n\n\nThe navigation menu is the menu on the top-left that allows the user to navigate between subsections of the\nadministrative user interface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRole\n\n\nUser Interface\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nROLE_UI_NAV\n\n\nDisplay navigation menu\n\n\n\n\n\n\nROLE_UI_NAV_RECORDINGS_VIEW\n\n\nDisplay navigation menu entry \nRecordings\n\n\n\n\n\n\nROLE_UI_NAV_CAPTURE_VIEW\n\n\nDisplay navigation menu entry \nCapture\n\n\n\n\n\n\nROLE_UI_NAV_SYSTEMS_VIEW\n\n\nDisplay navigation menu entry \nSystems\n\n\n\n\n\n\nROLE_UI_NAV_ORGANIZATION_VIEW\n\n\nDisplay navigation menu entry \nOrganization\n\n\n\n\n\n\nROLE_UI_NAV_CONFIGURATION_VIEW\n\n\nDisplay navigation menu entry \nConfiguration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to provide access to the navigation menu, \nROLE_UI_NAV\n is needed. Then, for each of the\nnavigation menu entries, include the respective role if the menu entry should be accessible by the user.\n\n\nNote that this really just controls the navigation menu and its menu entries. Not less, not more.\n\n\nRecordings: Events\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRole\n\n\nUser Interface\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nROLE_UI_EVENTS_VIEW\n\n\nDisplay \nEvents\n

Given\nsuch a group, you can just add users to that group and they will get all the roles of the group which includes\nroles that allow the users to access specific parts of the UI.  Please consult the  Groups section  for information about adding new groups.  There is a set of so-called user interface roles, each of them providing access to a specific part of the \nadministrative user interface. Those roles can be easily identified by their name prefix  ROLE_UI .  Important   ROLE_ADMIN  implicitly provides full access to the user interface. When working with role-based\nvisibility, users (and the groups they belong to) may not have  ROLE_ADMIN  therefore.",

It is important to understand that the UI roles are not coupled, i.e. having a particular role does not imply any other\npermission than the one exactly provided by the role.  Example: Just having the role  ROLE_UI_NAV_CAPTURE_VIEW  won't display the navigation menu. This requires the role ROLE_UI_NAV , too.  The advantage of having independent roles is that it makes role-based visibility even more flexible, For example, it is\npossible to not use the navigation menu at all. The drawback of this approach is that it makes configuration more\nadvanced. But configuring role-based visibility is not a daily tasks.",
