New Plugin Management
---------------------

Some parts of Opencast have become plugins and are now disabled by default but can be easily enabled again by flipping a
single configuration option.

For a list of plugins, take a look at `etc/org.opencastproject.plugin.impl.PluginManagerImpl.cfg` or the documentation:

- [The Plugin Management Documentation](modules/plugin-management.md)
