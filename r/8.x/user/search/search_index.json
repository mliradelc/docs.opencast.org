Opencast is supported by a growing international community that includes over 200 members from more than 100 organizations. About this Documentation This set of documentation is written for users who will primarily access and use Opencast through the administrative user interfaces. If you are interested in technical documentation on how to install, extend, or integrate Opencast these documents will provide further details: The Opencast Release Documentation is the official Opencast documentation for each release. This is actually one part of th release documentation intended for users. There are also guides for administrators and developers. The Opencast Adopter Guides contain community created guides for Opencast. Often these describe the usage of external tools (reverse proxies, streaming servers, \u2026) or configurations used by a particular adopter. No quality assurance is done for this wiki, but there are certainly a lot of valuable information to find. The Opencast Development Wiki is used by developers to store working drafts, ideas and temporary documentation for active development.

The AssetManager resolves some of the shortcomings of the Archive, such as Complexity The Archive architecture, with its implementation specific metadata schemas, turned out to be too complex and not used in practice Offline storage Adopters requested the need to move assets offline which cannot be handled with the Archive. The AssetManager lays the ground for this, with futher improvements and features to follow. Properties Services often need to store some properties along with a media package to accomplish their tasks. This leads to services creating their own persistence layer which increases the overall complexity of the system. The AssetManager provides a simple yet powerful annotation API to set key/value properties on media packages. Queries The Archive only provided a very simple query interface supporting boolean AND operations. The AssetManager, equipped with a comprehensive query language, supporting complex SQL-like queries. Bandwidth To reduce database IO, the AssetManager\u2019s query language supports the selection of only parts of a media package. Name The name Archive did not properly describe its purpose. It has been used as an archive but also as a hub for starting workflows and managing assets. This may have caused confusion here and there which should be replaced by the new name AssetManager. Please read on to learn about the complete feature set. Terms Before we move on to the list of features let\u2019s clarify some terms. Media package The media package is the central data structure within Opencast that refers to a collection of different types of elements, e.g. video tracks, metadata catalogs, attachments that belong together. See also \u21d2episode. Media package element Each element contained in a media package, like video tracks and metadata catalogs, are referred to as a media package element. Asset This is a media package element under the control of the AssetManager. This implies that each asset, unlike a raw media package element, has a version. Property Key/value metadata stored with an \u21d2episode. Snapshot A snapshot is the immutable, versioned \u201ccopy\u201d that the AssetManager takes of a media package. Episode An episode is the complete history of snapshots of a media package. It can be associated with \u21d2properties. Availability A flag that indicates if an \u21d2asset is online or offline. Availability is managed per \u21d2episode. Target A target defines the data that should be fetched from the database and is used to reduce database IO by fetching only what\u2019s actually needed. Features General This section describes the features defined by the AssetManager API. Versioned storage of media packages Media package snapshots are stored in an immutable, versioned manner. Each snapshot operation creates a new single version of the media package and all of its assets. Properties Properties of various data types can be saved along with an episode. This frees services from implementing their own persistence layer if they need to store metadata along with an episode. Properties are a key/value store. The key is a tuple consisting of a namespace name and the key name, which allows properties to be grouped. Query language SQL-like query language. Default Implementation Find below the features of the default implementation. Asset store API This is an API for pluggable storage backends, supporting operations to store, retrieve and delete assets. The default implementation of the store saves assets in the file system leveraging the Workspace service in order to reduce data transfers. REST endpoint Provides support for the most basic operations of the AssetManager. Disc space management If an asset has not been modified between two snapshots, the AssetManager is able to save disk space by creating hard links. The underlying file system needs to support this feature. HttpAssetProvider API The central transport protocol of Opencast is HTTP, with media package elements accessible via URLs. When a saved media package is being delivered, the HttpAssetProvider rewrite the URLs of media package elements to point to a valid HTTP endpoint. The bundled REST endpoint implements this interface. Security Access to the AssetManager is secured based on the organization, user roles and media package ACLs.","title":"Asset Manager"},{"location":"asset-manager/#overview","text":"The AssetManager is the successor of the Archive.

Events Events refer to a single episode or lecture that is recorded or uploaded. Typically they belong to a Series (see also Series section), however there can also be ad-hoc recordings that do not belong to a Series. You can access the Events page from the Main Menu > Recordings > Events . Ad-hoc events Ad-hoc events that occur spontaneously and may or may not belong to a Series. An example of an adhoc recording may be a recording of a dissertation practice or a recording of an unplanned meeting. Note: Not all capture agents support ad-hoc recordings. Refer to the capture agent\u2019s manual to find out if it has this capability. Series A Series is the equivalent of entire course and typically contains multiple Events (see also Events section) that occur across a defined period of time. You can access the Events page from the Main Menu > Recordings > Series . An example of a Series which consists of four (4) events: Series Name: Better Development Through the Use of Scrum Techniques Event 1: Introduction to Scrum Event 2: Sprint Planning Event 3: Daily Scrum Event 4: Sprint Review Meeting Events that belong to a Series inherit properties such as Access Policy and Themes. Engage Player The default video player that ships with Opencast and enables users to view and interact with video and related video metadata Publication channel The location where a video has been published, for example, you may publish your video to your LMS or Youtube each of these are considered a publication channel by Opencast. A video can be published to multiple publication channels simultaneously. Metadata Utilized by Opencast as descriptive data to describe the different objects (series, events, recordings). Modal Window A modal window is a graphical element used in Opencast that displays over the applications main window. The modal window is considered a child window that requires users to interact with it before they can return to the main Opencast application. An example of a model window can be seen by clicking the edit icon ( ) on the Actions column within the Event table view. Capture Agent (CA) A software or hardware device to record speakers, meetings, lectures, and other types of events. It typically captures audio and video (VGA/DVI), and, depending on software and hardware support, various video sources. Tasks Tasks are utilized by Opencast to define production processes. They contains a series of operations (also called Jobs) that instructs the Opencast system on how video is captured, encoded, archived, and distributed. Themes Enable an administrator to brand recordings using intro video, title slides, and watermarks. Themes can be applied on a per Series or per Event basis. Comments Comments can be added to an Event along with a reason to alert another administrator that something is wrong or the Event needs further review. Comments allow the user to comment, respond, and resolve. Presenter A presenter is a person that is presenting and will be seen or heard in the audio or video recordings. Contributor A contributor to a series is a person that will not be seen or heard in the recording but may have developed the talk or is acting as an assistant to the Presenter. In a University setting this person may be a graduate or teaching assistant. Organizers An organizer is the person or system that scheduled a Series. Roles Roles allow an administrator to define permissions on a per-user or per-group basis.","title":"Glossary"},{"location":"glossary/#glossary","text":"","title":"Glossary"},{"location":"glossary/#recordings","text":"A general term used to describe activities that occur within an Opencast system including Series and Events.","title":"Recordings"},{"location":"glossary/#events","text":"Events refer to a single episode or lecture that is recorded or uploaded.

Examples include language choice, date and time formats and number formats. This type of work is often referred to as internationalization , or i18n, which is the design and development of an application content that enables easy localization for target audiences that vary in culture, region, or language. It is often written i18n, where 18 is the number of letters between i and n in the English word. Localization , or i10n, is the process of adapting internationalized software for a specific region or language by adding locale-specific components and translating text. Localization utilizes the infrastructure or flexibility provided by internationalization to enable adopters to translate the application into their language of choice. If you do not see your language and would like to contribute it, or make corrections to current translations, you can join the Opencast Internationalization team by creating an account (free) on the Crowdin platform .

Using that mechanism, it is possible to configure what parts of the UI (and therefore functionality) are visibile to a given user based on the user's roles. Hence, we call that mechanism role-based visibility. How To Use The best practise to assign a larger set of roles to a user is to use Opencast's support for user groups. This way, you can define a group whose roles provide access to the parts of the UI you want to provide access to. Given such a group, you can just add users to that group and they will get all the roles of the group which includes roles that allow the users to access specific parts of the UI. Please consult the Groups section for information about adding new groups. There is a set of so-called user interface roles, each of them providing access to a specific part of the administrative user interface. Those roles can be easily identified by their name prefix ROLE_UI . Important ROLE_ADMIN implicitly provides full access to the user interface. When working with role-based visibility, users (and the groups they belong to) may not have ROLE_ADMIN therefore. User Interface Roles This section describes which roles permit access to what parts of the user interface. Note that role-based visibility is not just hiding graphical elements from users, it does also protect server-side resources from unauthorized access if necessary. It is important to understand that the UI roles are not coupled, i.e. having a particular role does not imply any other permission than the one exactly provided by the role. Example: Just having the role ROLE_UI_NAV_CAPTURE_VIEW won't display the navigation menu. This requires the role ROLE_UI_NAV , too. The advantage of having independent roles is that it makes role-based visibility even more flexible, For example, it is possible to not use the navigation menu at all. The drawback of this approach is that it makes configuration more advanced. But configuring role-based visibility is not a daily tasks. General Access Important: ROLE_ADMIN_UI is required for accessing the admin ui in general in means of providing access to some often used resources Role User Interface ROLE_ADMIN_UI Allow user to access login page as well as commonly used resources Navigation Menu The navigation menu is the menu on the top-left that allows the user to navigate between subsections of the administrative user interface.

Then, for each of the navigation menu entries, include the respective role if the menu entry should be accessible by the user.
