    8.x specific fixes for the markdown generation code
    
    For some reason markdown-inline-graphviz-extension-png needs to be
    installed separately, after the rest of the markdown modules.  It's
    unclear why exactly this is happening, but it's also not happening in
    9.x so it's not worth the time to debug why.
