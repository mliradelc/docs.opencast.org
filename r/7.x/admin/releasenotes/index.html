    <h1 id="opencast-7-release-notes">Opencast 7: Release Notes</h1>
<h2 id="new-features">New Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Overhaul of the permission management with the newly added possibility to define how access control lists are
  evaluated and how series permission changes are populated to episodes. For more details take a look at the <a href="../configuration/acl/">access
  control configuration guide</a>.</li>
<li>Update Elasticsearch and make it possible to run Elasticsearch as an external service.</li>
<li>Per-Tenant Capture Agent Users</li>
<li>Asset manager snaphots clean-up to remove older snapshots for a given media package. In some cases, this can
  drastically reduce Opencast's storage consumption. This feature is implemented as an option for the
  <a href="../workflowoperationhandlers/asset-delete-woh/">asset-delete workflow operation handler</a>.</li>
<li>Allow the workflow to select the audio track for composite video</li>
<li>Add multi-tenant support for all list providers</li>
<li>Make waveform size configurable</li>
<li>Create a generic user interface configuration service</li>
<li>In the events table add a link to the series details</li>
<li>Add internationalization support for series LTI tools</li>
<li>Display creator of workflow</li>
<li>Allow the ingest service to make authenticated requests to other servers</li>
<li>Some modules are now plugins. These are not started by default to reduce the amount of code running unnecessarily.
  They can easily be enabled in <code>etc/org.apache.karaf.features.cfg</code>. Modified modules are:<ul>
<li>Moodle user directory</li>
<li>Sakai user directory</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="improvements">Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improved performance when scheduling new events or checking for conflicts (reducing the time for adding
multiple schedules by up to 90%).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="configuration-changes">Configuration changes</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>etc/org.opencastproject.scheduler.impl.SchedulerServiceImpl.cfg</code> has a new option <code>maintenance</code> which temporarily
  disables the scheduler if set to <code>true</code>.</li>
<li><code>KARAF_NOROOT</code> is now set to <code>true</code> by default, preventing Opencast to be started as root user unless the
  configuration is changed.</li>
<li>The default configuration for the Paella player has been moved to <code>etc/ui-config/mh_default_org/paella/config.json</code></li>
<li>By default, metadata catalogs and attachments sent by capture agents are discarded since this data is usually
  controlled by Opencast and the routing through capture agents which existed for historical reasons was just an
  additional source for errors. If you rely on the old behavior, it can be configured in
  <code>etc/org.opencastproject.ingest.impl.IngestServiceImpl.cfg</code>.</li>
<li>By default, the Paella player now respects all tracks published to engage instead of having a hard-coded filter for
  tracks with the sub-flavor <code>delivery</code> only.</li>
<li>The structure of the configuration files concerning URL signing has changed. See the
<a href="../configuration/stream-security/">stream security configuration</a> for more details.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="api-changes">API changes</h2>
<p>Due to <a href="https://opencast.jira.com/browse/MH-13397">MH-13397</a>:</p>

<h2 id="additional-notes-about-71">Additional Notes About 7.1</h2>
<p>Opencast 7.1 is the first maintenance release for Opencast 7. It fixes a bug with the scheduler migration which may have
caused minor issues for old, processed events which were missing some metadata. If you have already migrated to
Opencast 7.0 and experience this problem, simply re-start the scheduler migration and re-build the index once more.</p>
<h2 id="additional-notes-about-72">Additional Notes About 7.2</h2>
<p>Opencast 7.2 fixes a bug in the video editor configuration present in Opencast 7.0 to 7.1 which will cause Opencast to
always silently skip the video editor and publish the whole video. The problem was introduced by <a href="https://github.com/opencast/opencast/pull/944">a fix in the default
workflows</a> and later fixed again by a <a href="https://github.com/opencast/opencast/pull/1013">configuration change therein
</a>. If you use the default workflows, please make sure to update to the
latest state of the workflows.</p>
<p>If you use your own workflow and did not adapt the first patch, you should not be affected by this problem at all. If
you are, just make sure that source and target smil flavor for the editor workflow operation are identical like it is
ensured <a href="https://github.com/opencast/opencast/pull/1013">by the official fix</a>. A proper solution not relying on specific
configurations and less error prone is in work and will be added to the upcoming major Opencast release.</p>
<h2 id="additional-notes-about-73">Additional Notes About 7.3</h2>
<p>Opencast 7.3 fixes a bug where the audio-source-name parameter of the composite operation defaults to none instead of
"dual" in distributed systems, causing the resulting video to have no audio. A workaround for this problem entails
setting audio-source-name to "dual" explicitly. Additionally this release fixes another problem in the composite WOH
where using the watermark tool causes the operation to fail.</p>
<p>This release also solves a major problem during the index rebuild of the workflow service where the process will
sometimes fail with an OutOfMemory error because it's attempting to load all workflows at once. This problem is averted
by loading and processing the workflows in increments instead. If you encountered this problem or plan to update to 7
and have a lot of workflows in your system, you should update to 7.3.</p>
<p>7.3 also ensures that the start dates shown in the events table and in the event details are once more consistent by
using the bibliographic for both instead of showing the technical date in the events table since this can't be updated
via UI for uploaded events and leads to confusion.</p>
<p>Last but not least this release also fixes a known security vulnerability in Apache Santuario, so it is encouraged to
update.</p>
<h2 id="additional-notes-about-74">Additional Notes About 7.4</h2>
<p>Opencast 7.4 brings a performance fix for some queries in the search API that can cause Opencast to run out of memory.</p>
<p>This release also gives back a patch that was in version 6.x that allows to filter capture agent roles for ACLs and
fixes the date cell of the events overview table in the admin UI.</p>
<p>Finally, Opencast 7.4 also brings an update to the CAS security example that was out of date.</p>
<h2 id="additional-notes-about-75">Additional Notes About 7.5</h2>
<p>Opencast 7.5 fixes behaviour where the bibliographic date was not changed when changing the technical date via Rest.
Also an option was added to disable thumbnail generation in the video editor because it can lead to performance issues.</p>
<h2 id="additional-notes-about-76">Additional Notes About 7.6</h2>
<p>Opencast 7.6 fixes a number of security issues. Upgrading is strongly recommended.
Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/opencast/opencast/security/advisories">security advisories</a> for more details.</p>
<p>One change is that the OAI-PMH endpoint is no longer publicly accessible by default.
If you need it to be, you can easily change that in the security configuration at <code>etc/security/mh_default_org.xml</code>.</p>

<h2 id="additional-notes-about-77">Additional Notes About 7.7</h2>
<p>Opencast 7.7 brings better ACLs handling, remember-me authentication fix and other minor
improvements.</p>
<h2 id="additional-notes-about-78">Additional Notes about 7.8</h2>
<p>Opencast 7.8 contains multiple fixes for the Theodul Player to better support Audio-Only files. Additionally some other
bugs were resolved and dependencies were updated to address security issues.</p>
<h2 id="additional-notes-about-79">Additional Notes about 7.9</h2>
<p>Opencast 7.9 contains an important security fix regarding host verification. Upgrading is strongly recommended. If you
use self-signed certificates, you now need to properly import them.
Additionally, the UI of the docs were improved and and the Spring snapshot repository was removed to resolve build
problems.</p>
