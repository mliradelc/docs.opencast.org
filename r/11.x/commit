    Add missing tags in encode WOH
    
    Tags for different output files were missing in encode WOH, because
    the comparison of the output file name to a specified suffix stopped
    working after 19c0940c.
    The reason for this is that the files were renamed not including
    the specified suffix, and comparison for the suffix as a condition
    for adding a tag is used.
    Fixes the issue by remembering the original file name from encoding.
    
    Resolves #3639
