    Auto-generated series for Capture Agents
    
    Integrated code from switchcast in the ingest-service module to auto-generate a series, if an event without series is ingested. Events without series may be inaccessible for users without admin rights. So this patch provides, that people with rights to the CA have access to the respective series and the contained events.
