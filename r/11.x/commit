    Clarify that #3715 was a fix in the release notes
    
    #3715 was a bug fix, not a feature.
    Sorry for the long PR discussion, which looks confusing but was
    neccessary to find consensus on how to fix the unterlaying bug.
    The bug itself was introduced when the metadata save button
    first appeared.
