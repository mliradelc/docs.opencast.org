    Fix bug with adding a series when a deleted one still lingers
    
    `this.deleteSeries` only marks the series as deleted again, not actually
    removing it. This will clash if a series with the same ID is added again
    as it will cause a unique constraint violation. Instead, we completely
    remove it here. Unfortunately, without the `flush` it didn't work: the
    unique violation was still triggered. Whether `flush` is the best
    solution: ðŸ¤·, I hardly know stuff about JPA.
