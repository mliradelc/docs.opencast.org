    Fix frontend-no-prebuilt profile (#3444)
    
    This patch fixes the frontend-no-prebuilt maven profile which can be
    used to have maven run the local npm version instead of downloading one.
    That has the big advantage of not having to remove any `none*` folders
    when you switch versions.
    
    To try this, run:
    
    ```
    ‚ùØ mvn clean install -Pdev,frontend-no-prebuilt
    ```
    
    The profile did exist for a long time but was broken due to some tasks
    being executed in the wrong order like trying to copy the frontend to
    the target folder before actually building it.
