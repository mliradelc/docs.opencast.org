    Fix posible type change in external API (#3231)
    
    PR #3148 introduced a possible type change in the external API from int
    to string for the duration field of tracks in case the field is `null`.
    As discussed, this PR changes the return value to JSON `null` instead.
    
    Note that the behavior is still inconsistend when it comes to durations:
    
    * `{eventId}/media` will omit the field
    * Event duration has a type change to `""`
    * this changes Track duration to `null`
    
    This patch leave the behavior of `{eventId}/media` as this is done with
    all the fields. The Event duration though now also returns JSON `null`
    as default value.
