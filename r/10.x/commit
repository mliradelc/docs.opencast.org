    Document that you cannot run Opencast in a sub-path
    
    This patch makes it clear that Opencast does not support being run in a
    sub-path of a domain (e.g. `example.org/opencast`) but needs to be run
    in the root of that domain. You can, of course, use a subdomain (e.g.
    `opencast.example.com`).
