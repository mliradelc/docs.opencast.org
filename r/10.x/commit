    Add opencast_major_version to docs
    
    This is showing off how we could add an opencast_major_version macro to
    the Opencast documentation. This might be helpful for things like the
    installation guides.
    
    Comments are welcome. Integration in deployments is still missing. But
    it should be obvious how that would look like.
