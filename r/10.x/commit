    Rename Files Workflow Operation Handler (#3389)
    
    * Rename Files Workflow Operation Handler
    
    This patch adds a new workflow operation handler to rename files
    referenced in media package tracks based on metadata contained in the
    media package.
    
    The workspace is used to access the files, assuring that Opencast
    can get access, no matter where the data is stored. If it can get
    access, of course.
