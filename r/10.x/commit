    Force same sample rate for audio files in PartialImport WOH encoding profiles
    
    During concatenation of input audio files and generated silent audio files, "Non-monotonous DTS" warnings could appear and the output file would be distorted. For example, the output file could have a different length from the sum of its parts or the quality would be significantly lowered. Forcing the same sample rate alleviates the problem (thanks Lars!).
