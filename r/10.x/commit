    Merge pull request from GHSA-qm6v-cg9v-53j3
    
    This patch fixes the issue that users can pass URLs from other tenants
    to the ingest service which will check only against the other
    organization but not against the one currently active. This allows users
    to easily ingest media from other tenants.
