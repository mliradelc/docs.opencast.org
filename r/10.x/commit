    Fix SQL query by using `true` instead of `1` for bool comparison
    
    This queries fails in PostgreSQL databases. The literal `true` is, as
    far as my searches show, defined in the standard SQL. This works for
    the M2 database. I also tested a dummy query with `true` on MySQL and
    PostgreSQL databases and everything worked out.
