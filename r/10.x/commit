    Add dfxp as subtitle format to LTI upload (#2804)
    
    Added dfxp subtitle support
    
    This adds the possibility to upload dfxp subtitles via the LTI upload module.
    When using webvtt you will be prompted to set the language of the subtitles, when using dfxp the language will be parsed from the subtitle file itself, so there is no need to manually set this.
