    Fixed publication pop-overs overlaying each other
    
    Circumvents the problem by closing all other publication pop-overs when opening a new one. This means the pop-overs can potentially still overlap with other elements (e.g. the filter dropdown), but maybe that's not a bug but a feature.
    
    Resolves #2519
