    Fix variable always resolving to the default value even when set
    
    Workflow variables such as `${my-var:my-default}` would always be
    resolved to `my-default` even when `my-var` is set. This is because
    the variable lookup incorrectly uses `my-var:my-default` instead
    of simply `my-var`.
