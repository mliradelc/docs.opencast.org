    Fix memory leak / performance in the LTI upload and job overview (#2263)
    
    This removes the constant polling to the metadata endpoint, which isn't really necessary and caused a memory issue in the browser when this page remains open for a long time. The update interval for the joblist also changed from 1sec to 30 sec.
    
    This closes  #2246
