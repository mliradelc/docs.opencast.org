    Remove logging-1.11.6 from distributions
    
    This patch entirely removes the logging-1.11.6 bundles for log4j from
    Opencast's assemblies. Technically, this makes noo difference, since it
    wasn't used any longer anyway. Nevertheless, this could avoid confusion
    if people do find the old, vulnerable version of Log4J somewhere on the
    filesystem.
