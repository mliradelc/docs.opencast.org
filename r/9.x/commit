    Remove Reference of Further Documentation
    
    This patch removes the reference of further documentation from the
    bottom of the documentation index page. IRC does not exist any longer
    and what is left is hardly documentation but only communication
    channels which are all highlighted quite nicely on the documentation
    landing page.
