    Fixing unchecked directory list() call.
    
    This change resolves an issue report on the users list where retracting would
    sometimes cause NPEs when the list().length check was done.  Reading the docs
    closely, .list() returns null in the case where the File is *not* a directory,
    or if an IO error occurs.  Since an IO error will likely show up as a *ton* of
    other errors, we're going to check if the .list() call returns null, and assume
    that a null here is because the File isn't pointing at a directory.  This
    probably shouldn't be happening, but we'll try and delete whatever it's
    pointing at anyway.
