    Ignore NoSuchFileException when cleaning directories
    
    The `RecursiveDirectoryCleaner` is used to clean up the workspace and
    working file repository. If multiple Openacst instances run on a shared
    file system, one could delete files before the other, leading to a
    `NoSuchFileException`. These can be ignored as the file is already deleted.
