    Do not run dependabot pushes multiple times
    
    We do not need to run test on dependabot pushes, as they are already
    covered by its pull requests.
    
    This is an alternative approach to #4187, filtering on the event level.
    Dependabot always creates branches under `dependabot/**`. According to
    the docs [0] there is a suitable filter:
    
    > When using the `push` event, you can configure a workflow to run on
    > specific branches or tags.
    >
    > Use the `branches` filter when you want to include branch name
    > patterns or when you want to both include and exclude branch names
    > patterns. Use the `branches-ignore` filter when you only want to
    > exclude branch name patterns. You cannot use both the `branches` and
    > `branches-ignore` filters for the same event in a workflow.
