    Make Workflow Operation Docs Look Alike
    
    This patch starts adjusting the workflow operation handler documentation
    to always use a similar template, starting with the operations name and
    it's identifier and, not using the Java class name and ending with an
    example in a similar format with syntax highlighting enabled.
    
    This does not yet update all workflow operation handler docs.
