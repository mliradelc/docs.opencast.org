    Fixing single radio buttons in the admin ui new-tasks dialog (#4274)
    
    Previous behaviour caused the radio button's value to be reset to null,
    which was displayed as a single "*" rather than the correct 'true' or
    'false' in the summary screen, and was sent back as a straight null to
    the endpoint.
