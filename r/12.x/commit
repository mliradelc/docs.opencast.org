    Make Delete Dialog Look Alike
    
    This patch fixes the issue that all three of Opencast's delete dialog
    (event, series, batch) do not look alike.
    
    This patch mostly adjust the event delete dialog to look like the series
    dialog. It now has one warning less, but the simpler structure adopted
    for visual clarity makes it hopefully clearer what is going on and easier
    to understand.
    
    Additionally, all three dialog now use a red “Delete” button to confirm
    the process instead of using “Confirm” at some places.
