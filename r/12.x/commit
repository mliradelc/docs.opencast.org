    Save button for event/series "Access policy"-tab (#4308)
    
    - This should fix the problem with racecondition when editig acces rights in the admin-ui.
    - Changes to roles can now be submitted all at once (with button "Save & update event permissions") and are no longer automatically submitted with each change
    - User must now confirm unsaved changes (like in metadata-tab)
    - Save-Button for saving changes (but not submitting)
