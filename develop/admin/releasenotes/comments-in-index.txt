 Add comments in the event index #4029

 Adds comment reason, text and resolvedStatus to the events index. This allows for filtering events by certain comments
 in the Admin UI by using the searchbar. For example, if you are using the notes column in the events table, you could
 search for all events that have a note that contains "silent".

 This requires an index rebuild.
