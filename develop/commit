    Refactor Index Rebuild (#2211)
    
    * Move Index Rebuild to its own service
    
    Remove the index rebuild from the AbstractSearchIndex and put it into
    it's own service and module to simplify dependencies.
    
    * Move AbstractSearchIndex to new module
    
    Move the AbstractSearchIndex and related classes to its own module so
    other modules can use it without depending on the index service.
    
    * Rename IndexRebuild module, add IndexProducer
    
    Rename IndexRebuildService module to IndexRebuild, add IndexProducer
    classes to keep all parts related to the index rebuild mesages in one
    spot.
    
    * Remove useless doc comment links
    
    These attempted to link to the abstract method that was overwritten
    by the commented method. But:
    
    - This is not necessary. Javadoc already detects, shows and links the
      overwritten method.
    - The links were broken/outdated.
    - The line was longer than 120 chars which is why it was noticed by
      checkstyle.
    
    * Rename module search-index
    
    * Rename search and search-api modules
