    Change the way workflows are stored in the database from XML to tables (#3376)
    
    Currently, workflows are stored as a single XML object in the database. This makes it difficult/inperformant to use more complex queries, which is why workflow information is also stored in a Solr Index. In preparation for removing Solr from the Workflow Service, this PR creates new database tables for workflow information.
    
    Key changes:
    
    - Workflow information is now stored in tables named "oc_workflow*"
    - Workflow information is no longer stored in the job tables "payload" column. Instead, it stores the workflow_id there (which is the same id as the corresponding "START_WORKFLOW" job, so it is actually kinda superfluous)
    - Therefore, the WorkflowInstance and WorkflowOperationInstance classes are now using JPA annotations instead of JAXB annotations.
    - Workflows still require XML representations for e.g. REST endpoints, so corresponding JAXB classes for that purposes are added
    - Requires a db upgrade script. The script is a python script, placed in the usual sport for db upgrade scripts.
    - Adds an endpoint that allows to query for workflow instances by mediapackage id
