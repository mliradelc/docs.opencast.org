    Remove Solr from series service (#3204)
    
    Removes all Solr functionality from the series service. Functions that
    relied on the Solr index were either removed or now query the database
    directly.
    
    - Moved the series filter query to the External API, while trying to
      preserve as much functionality as possible (for example, there is no
      pagination, so instead an offset variable is offered)
    - ExternalAPI: Get Series directly from ES index instead of the roundabout way through the index service
    - AdminUIAPI: Get Series directly from ES index instead of the roundabout way through the index service
    - StatisticsEndpoints: Get Series directly from ES index instead of the roundabout way through the index service
    - IndexService: Get Series directly from ES index instead of the roundabout way through the index service
    - Removed index ACL update from function in SeriesServiceImpl where it served no purpose
    - Get series by title from elasticsearchindex in IngestServiceImpl.java
