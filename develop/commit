    New  woh: select-version (#2596)
    
    * New select-version woh, which replaces the current mp with another version from the asset manager.
    
    * Address reviewer comments: better check of operation config, add how to find mp version to documentation.
    
    * Removed part of doc because it isn't reliable.
    
    * Rebased and now using osgi annotations.
    
    * Rebased and fixed conflict.
