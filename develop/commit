    Regenerate `package-lock.json` (#3443)
    
    This patch regenerates our project's `package-lock.json` files since most
    of them were originally generated with old `npm` versions and running
    `npm ci` is constantly complaining that the format has slightly changed:
    
    ```
    ‚ùØ npm ci
    npm WARN old lockfile
    npm WARN old lockfile The package-lock.json file was created with an old version of npm,
    npm WARN old lockfile so supplemental metadata must be fetched from the registry.
    npm WARN old lockfile
    npm WARN old lockfile This is a one-time fix-up, please be patient...
    npm WARN old lockfile
    ```
    
    This should fix that issue.
