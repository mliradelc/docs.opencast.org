    Fix metrics exporter Prometheus dependency
    
    This PR embeds all relevant Prometheus dependencies
    (even transitive ones) into the `metrics-exporter` bundle,
    some new ones were missing due to the `0.11.0` update.
    The update also seems to add some new functionality related
    to OpenTelemetry, which we don't use (:crossed_fingers:),
    but which we still need to exlude from the generated `Import-Packages`
    header.
