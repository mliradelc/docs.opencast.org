    Sign publication URL of events in External API (#3002)
    
    The External API already offers a parameter to pre-sign distribution
    URLs when requesting one or more events with their publications.
    Starting with version 1.7.0 this change will also pre-sign the
    publication URLs itselves when that flag is set.
