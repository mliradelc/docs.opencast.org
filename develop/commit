    Limit Deployment to Opencast Community Repository
    
    The deployment of documentation and translation keys as well as the
    update of translations would run on all repositories, failing on all but
    the community repository due to missing repository secrets. This will
    cause unnecessary failure notices to be sent to the owners.
    
    This patch changes the behavior, running the workflows only within the
    Opencast GitHub organization
