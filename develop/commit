    Removed Solr from Series Service (#3161)
    
    * Removed Solr from Series Service
    
    Removes all Solr functionality from the series service. Functions that
    relied on the solr index were either removed or now query the database
    directly.
    
    - Moved the series filter query to the external api, while trying to
      preserve as much functionality as possible (for example, there is no
    pagination, so instead an offset variable is offered)
    
    * Fixed wrong variable name in SeriesEndpoint.java
    
    * Fixed missing imports
