    Fail on configuration error (#4014)
    
    This patch lets the video editor fail on configuration errors instead of
    silently using a different configurations. If adopters change the
    configuration, they want a specific effect and if they mess up, they
    should be able to notice that right away and not only several videos are
    processed and someone accidentally notices that the setting they made
    aren't actually applied.
