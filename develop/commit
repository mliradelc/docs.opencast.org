    Simplify ldap user directory implementation (#4383)
    
    * simplify ldap user directory implementation
    
    Reuse logic of OpencastLdapAuthoritiesPopulator implementation in opencast's user directory.
    
    * remove mixing ldap authorities with internal ones
    
    The OpencastLdapAuthoritiesPopulator returned a mixture of LDAP and
    internal authorities. The OpencastLdapAuthoritiesPopulator achieved
    this by retrieving the user object via the security service.
    This prevents reusing the populator in the LDAP user directory implementation
    because it results in a recursion.
    
    * Add UserDetailsContextMapper implementation
    
    Providing the UserDetailsContextMapper as an alternative to the
    LdapAuthoritiesMapper offers all opencast roles instead of only roles
    derived from LDAP. The OpencastUserDetailsMapper provides a
    UserDetails object from Opencast's UserDetailsService, aka
    UserAndRoleDirectoryServiceImpl.
