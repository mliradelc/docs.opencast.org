    Faster Blend Effects on Cuts (#4013)
    
    * Faster Blend Effects on Cuts
    
    The blending effect (fading to black and back) is very slow in Opencast.
    It is sometimes even hiding important information in the videos.
    
    This patch changes the default configuration to have a much faster
    fading effect for cuts from the video editor.
    
    * Update etc/org.opencastproject.videoeditor.impl.VideoEditorServiceImpl.cfg
