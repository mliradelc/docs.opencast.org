    Fix random error with Maven dependency download in GitHub Actions
    
    In GitHub Actions sometimes the build fails due to Maven not been able
    to download dependencies. This is specific to the networking setup of
    GitHub. This PR adds suggested flags to the Maven commands that forces
    Maven to start new TCP connections instead of having long running ones.
