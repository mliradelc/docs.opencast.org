    Refactoring workflows and encoding profiles (#2573)
    
    This patch reduces the complexity by defining a clean and small set of features.
    
    The goals of refactoring:
    
    * Reduce the amount of workflows and encoding profiles as much as possible. Remove all workflows and encoding profiles thatâ€¦
      * aren't used any more
      * are there for historical reasons
      * are optional, very specific or uncommonly used
      * all workflows of disabled features (per default) should be removed, maybe put to the documentation of the feature itself
    * Keep the default set of predefined workflows and encoding profiles small
      * Structure and reuse workflow parts
      * Keep it small
    
    To achive the goals we have to make some assumptions:
    
    * Media quality selection for delivery formats could and should be done automaticly
    * We have to reduce the amount of predefined publication channels. In most production scenarios the set is static and does not change from episode to another. Here I decided to go with Engage/Search Index. But I leave a comment in the workflows, where you can put your prefered publication channels.
    * Keep the editor preview for ever. To use some important editor features we have to keep the editor preview and encode the delivery media from source.
    
    * Create feed, search and player preview images from 3rd second
    
    In case you have trimmed the video with the editor, the first two seconds are fade in. In this period, the extracted images are a bit darker as they should be.
